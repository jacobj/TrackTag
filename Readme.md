TrackTag
========

TrackTag is a rather simple Flask application for CIS 4301 @UF. The app originally used Oracle as the database as per requirements, but as it uses SQLAlchemy it should work with just about any database.

TrackTag's main purpose is to create an interface for tagging artist names and album titles with pop-culture/historical tags in order to organize the references made in those name/titles. We're hoping that these tags along with the track information can lead to some cool stats.
